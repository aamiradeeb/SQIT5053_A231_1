SQIT 5043 	Programming for analytics

Tasks:
You are required to individually do a  prototype / dashboard using python . 
The overall project would be 40% with 15% on a Technical Report, 15% on the Prototype/Dashboard and 10% for presentation

Analytic Prototype/Dashboard Project
An analytic system which includes (1) data retrieval and (2) development of quantitative modelling and 3) Visualisation of the output. Example of analytic system includes; 
Prediction of stock market based on yahoo finance (use of API) using machine learning
Consultant selection using AHP
Timetabling or Scheduling 
Forecasting dashboard
Etc.

Dataset: if youâ€™re dealing with Machine Learning type of project, you can use API or Beautifulsoup / Scrapy library. You can also retrieve other dataset such as: 

https://open.dosm.gov.my/ 

https://www.bnm.gov.my/publications/mhs 

https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis 

other open dataset platform  

Bonus marks will be given to projects that utilise web scraping/API, the use of SQL and visualisation. Hence the use of libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Numpy and other libraries are an added advantage. Extra points would also be given to projects that possess either commercial value or impact to the community to use.
